# Multiplayer Pokemon Project

This is a multiplayer Pokemon-style game built with JavaScript.

## Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get a copy of the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer. This will also install `npm` (Node Package Manager), which is needed to download the project's dependencies.

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository to your machine:**
    ```bash
    git clone <[your-repo-url-goes-here](https://github.com/vicsanity623/MultiplayerPokemon.git)>
    ```

2.  **Navigate into the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd MultiplayerPokemon-2
    ```

3.  **Install the necessary dependencies:** This command reads the `package.json` file and automatically downloads all the required libraries (like Express, Socket.io, etc.) into a `node_modules` folder on your machine.
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4.  **You're all set!** Open the `index.html` file in your browser to run the project.
